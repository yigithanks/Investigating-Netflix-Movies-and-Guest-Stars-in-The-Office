# Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Stars-in-The-Office

I successfully completed a data science project that required the application of Python skills acquired from both Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python courses. In this project, I focused on two main objectives:

Netflix Movie Duration Analysis: I investigated whether the duration of Netflix movies has been trending downward over time. To accomplish this, I used a range of Python techniques, including data manipulation with pandas and data visualization with matplotlib.

Guest Star Analysis in "The Office": I also delved into the world of the popular TV series "The Office" to identify which guest stars had the most appearances in the show's most popular episode. This involved data analysis using Python's lists and loops, alongside more advanced tools.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in essential data science skills, particularly in the area of exploratory data analysis. I successfully manipulated raw data and drew meaningful conclusions from data visualizations I created.

This project allowed me to demonstrate my ability to tackle real-world data science problems and provided me with practical experience that is highly relevant to the field.
